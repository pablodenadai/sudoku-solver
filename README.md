# TODO

- Write up README.md
- Rename `logical.js` with something better. (deductive-reasoning.js?)
- "Deductive reasoning" should:
 - Insert list of possible (or the only) numbers in given square (3d array)
- Backtracking should take advantage of possible numbers inserted above
- Better tests using XO/AVA
